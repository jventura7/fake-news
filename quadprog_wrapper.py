    """
    Wrapper for quadprog (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quadprog/) to make it more compatible with standard
    quadratic program constraint types. This function will solve
        minimize      x^T (hessian) x - (weights)^T x
        subject to  (eq_coeffs) x = (eq_constants)
        and         (ineq_coeffs) x <= (ineq_constants)
        and         (lower_bounds) <= x <= (upper_bounds)

    Note: when given a poorly conditioned problem, this wrapper will catch a failure exception thrown by quadprog,
    print a warning to the console, and return the all-zeros solution.
